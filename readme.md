# Ecstatic Palace Responsive Design project

What does it do and what does it need to fulfill?
This project uses skills learnt to build a mobile-first responsive website for the beauty salon Ecstatic Palace. It fulfills the need for clients and prospective clients to learn about the products and services provided, watch videos, join the newsletter subscriber base, enquire through the contact form to book services, as well as view pictures related to the services and products offered.
Functionality of project
The website is fully responsive, on desktop and larger screen sizes there is an amount of additional content (one picture on the header). The navigation is functional and two forms (Subscribe to the newsletter and Book us) are input validated which then resolves to a respective thankyou page. These forms are not fully functional in that they do not alert anyone from the Webteam that a form has been filled nor do they fill a database. 
Technologies used
•	HTML 5
•	CSS3
•	Bootstrap
•	GIT
•	GITHUB
•	Google Chrome developer tools (DevTools)
•	Font Awesome

## Deployment 
•	The website was coded in the Webstorm 2019.3.1., a local GIT directory was used for version control and then uploaded to GITHUB. Once it was in GITHUB repositories, it was made live using GITHUB pages. The website can be found at: 
http://localhost:63342/milestone1/about.html
## Testing
•	Each page was tested locally on the Github pages using Chrome developer tools, testing its functionality, as well as look and feel (in landscape and portrait mode) on Galaxy S5, Nexus 5S, Nexus 6P, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 plus, iPhone X, iPad, iPad pro and responsive desktop. All links were tested along with video player. The modal join fan club and the book us form was tested locally and remotely. 
1.	Example on how the Contact form was tested: 

i.	Go to the "Contact Us" page
ii.	Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
iii.	Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
iv.	Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

## Work based on other code
Only the modal Subscribe to our newsletter form code was re-used from the previous Whiskey Drop exercise. I modified its content and changed some of the code within it to reflect semantically what it was being used for.
